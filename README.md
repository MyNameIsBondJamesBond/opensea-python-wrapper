# OpenSea Python API Wrapper
A convenient package for interacting with the OpenSea API; which allows for retrieval of asset data from the OpenSea marketplace (https://opensea.io/).

# Warning about the dev branch
* Do not expect the dev branch to be stable or complete. 
* There is no documentation yet. To get a sense on how the package works, have a look at the endpoint classes in the open_sea_v1 folder. You'll probably want to instanciate an endpoint class, and call it's methods.
* There will be non backwards-compatible pushes and commit squashes on the dev branch.
